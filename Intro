interpreted and high level language
features=simple,platform independent(kissi bhi platform pe likh skte ho),provides big language support
db , web applications , data science , machine learning , complex app , easy to integrate with any
language.
modules : dusre ka code borrow krne mai use hota hai , kissi aur ne code likha hai aur use hum apne 
program mai use kr skte hai! 
we have two modules:
built in : already python ke sath aate hai
external modules: dusre ka code use kro
pip: Preferred Installer Program
in python evrything is object
list,dict,tuple
Ordered Collection is the one in which the position of each element is fixed. 
Example: List, strings, Tuples. Unordered Collection is the one in which position of 
each element is not fixed i.e., the order of all the elements are not maintained. 
Example: Sets, Dictionaries.

In Python, the pass statement is a null operation. It is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want to perform any action or code block. It is often used as a placeholder in situations where code will eventually go, but you're not ready to write that code yet.

Here's an example:

python
Copy code
if condition:
    # Code to be added later
    pass
else:
    print("Condition is False")
In this example, if the condition is true, the pass statement acts as a placeholder indicating that code will be added later. If the condition is false, it skips the pass statement and executes the code in the else block.

Without the pass statement, Python would raise an indentation error because it expects an indented block of code after the if statement.
